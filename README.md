# BackDooms
 A Backrooms style exploration WAD for Doom

Based on the Internet urban legend of The Backrooms, BackDooms is an attempt to recreate the same idea within Doom using only basic Doom textures and items (DOOM.wad and DOOM2.wad resources). The main room holds 4 players spawns to explore with friends, as well as many random deathmatch spawns for more random exploration. There is no end and no enemies in this map. Its purely for exploration and PvP. Requires DOOM2.wad to play.

As of version 1 the map contains 5 zones and 5 secrets/anomalies.
<br>
<br>
The 5 main zones are:
* Main
* Maze
* Second Floor
* Dark Rooms
* End
<br>
The map is quite simple and barren as (1) that's the point of the Backrooms, (2) Its my first ever map! and more of an opportunity to learn the tools and tricks of map making, and (3) the map is more focused on exploration than it is game play. More to come soon!
