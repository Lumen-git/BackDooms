# BackDooms
I found this WAD on a floppy disk jammed under the floorboards. Can you escape tha Back Dooms?

The Back Dooms is a Doom WAD based on the Back Rooms, a mono-yellow nightmare of infinite rooms with seemingly no use. Stuck in the Back Rooms, Doom Guy must find the 4 exit signs to reveal the main exit and escape! Good luck!


The wad file in the main repo will change as I mess around with the map. Always download the most recent release from the Releases tab for the current stable release.

Starting the game in the 2 easy modes will grant you a computer area map to help if you get too lost ;)
